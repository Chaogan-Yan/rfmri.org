The R-fMRI Network (rfmri.org) has been designed as a framework to support R-fMRI studies. The R-fMRI Network comprises R-fMRI researchers (the nodes) who are connected by sharing (the edges) with each other. Through the network, we can efficiently share ideas, comments, resources, tools, experiences, data, and our increasing knowledge of the brain. Researchers (nodes) with basic neuroscience, methodological, or clinical backgrounds can connect with each other in the network.  We hope the R-fMRI Network will help to enhance collaborations among researchers, especially to translate our knowledge of basic neuroscience and methodology to clinical applications (bench to bedside).
